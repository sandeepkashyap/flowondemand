########## OVERVIEW ##########

Access is an activeCollab (aC) theme that has been created to offer users something a little different. Using web 2.0 influences, Access is designed with a soft, easy to view interface while still highlighting important events and actions to the user.

!!!! Please do not use this theme on activeCollab 1.x as the markup and styles in activeCollab 2.0+ has changed a lot. If you are using activeCollab 1.x, please use Access 0.x for best results. !!!!
